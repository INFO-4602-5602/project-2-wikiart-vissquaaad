					Elephants are typically poached for their ivory tusk. Poaching is by far the single biggest threat facing elephant populations, more so then climate change and expanding human territory. One ivory tusk, of medium size, can cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and is worth more than gold, silver, cocaine, and oil. Some of ivory collections have been found to yield upwards of a million dollars. Due to the demand of ivory, for trophy reasons and traditional medicine, every three years, it is estimated that 100,000 elephants are poached for their tusks. Most common ways elephants are poached is through local tribes, who use their tradition hunting weapons, such as bows and arrows, however the rise of incidents of people using Ak 47 automatic rifles and go as far as to use grenades on whole herds. In 2013, more than 20,000 elephants were poached in Africa. Although elephant poaching is growing rapidly, it is being policed more and with the help of conservation groups, volunteers, local governments, and law enforcements, elephants could in fact be saved from extinction.
