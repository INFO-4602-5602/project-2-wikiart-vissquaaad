					Mohammad & Kiritchenkoâ€™s experiment was a study created to demonstrate different emotions and perspectives on pieces of art. In order to create and tell a story of this data and its results our group created four graphs that best compare and contrast different viewpoints of the art; To visualize different themes in the dataset, the four graphs we created are the following: Optimism vs. Pessimism, Happiness vs. Sadness, Love vs. Fear, and Overall Positive vs. Overall negative Emotions.

					Elephants are typically poached for their ivory tusk. Poaching is by far the single biggest threat facing elephant populations, more so then climate change and expanding human territory. One ivory tusk, of medium size, can cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and is worth more than gold, silver, cocaine, and oil. Some of ivory collections have been found to yield upwards of a million dollars. Due to the demand of ivory, for trophy reasons and traditional medicine, every three years, it is estimated that 100,000 elephants are poached for their tusks. Most common ways elephants are poached is through local tribes, who use their tradition hunting weapons, such as bows and arrows, however the rise of incidents of people using Ak 47 automatic rifles and go as far as to use grenades on whole herds. In 2013, more than 20,000 elephants were poached in Africa. Although elephant poaching is growing rapidly, it is being policed more and with the help of conservation groups, volunteers, local governments, and law enforcements, elephants could in fact be saved from extinction.

					This scatterplot shows the average positive and negative emotional rating for each artistic movement. Average emotional rating is calculated by taking the average value of positive or negative emotions for each. Each emotions value is calculated as the percentage of annotators who labeled a piece as evoking a given emotion. The positive emotions consist of Agreeableness, Gratitude, Happiness, Love, Optimism, and Trust. The negative emotions consist of Anger, Arrogance, Disagreeableness, Disgust, Fear, Pessimism, Regret Sadness, and Shame. Overall positive and negative emotions were calculated for each major artistic movement.
					<br/> <br/>
					The scatter plot was chosen as it allows the user to spatially see how each artistic movement balances positivity and negativity. Negative emotions are on the x-axis and positive emotions are on the y-axis. Each point represents a major artistic movement. They were given text labels so the user can easily distinguish each one without having to navigate a complex color legend. The graph helps users see which artistic movements are similar or different from one another in regard to their positively and negatively allowing for quick easy comparison. This serves as a broad representation of each movement and serves as an excellent starting point for deeper data exploration
